the two input files for this lab are test00in.txt and test01in.txt.

The first command is "./producer < test00in.txt" to read the content of the test00in.txt as input for producer. 
The test00in.txt has four lines:
qtgh
skjh
iopl
ngfv
25 bytes in total (5 bytes for each line including “\0”)
The second command is "./producer < test01in.txt" to read the content of the test01in.txt as input for producer. 
The test01in.txt has four lines:
uhgd
lkfg
egij
shlk
20 bytes in total (5 bytes for each line including “\0”)
The third command is "./consumer > test02out.txt" to save the output of the consumer to file test02out.txt. 
With three commands typed in three terminals, hit “enter” one by one(command 1, then command 2, then command 3) quickly and wait for all of them to finish.
As a result, the content of file test02out.txt should store the content of first file and then the second file.
From the testing, the test02out.txt that generated by the third command has 8 lines:
qtgh
skjh
iopl
ngfv
uhgd
lkfg
egij
shlk


The test02out.txt file shows that when each byte is transferred a single time by in the proper order from producers to one consumer. Additionally, when consumer get bytes one by one from one producer, another producer has to wait until the consumer finish reading the previous producer.
