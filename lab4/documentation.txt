Objective:  Learn shell scripting and its application in analyzing files.
script description
script_1 description: extracts specially formatted comments from C source files. 
script_2 description: For each source file that contains a main function, it displays the full path of the
file and append the number occurrences of printf and of fprintf as separate numbers. 
For each module file (i.e. a file that contains the function init_module), it list the
full path of the file and appends the number of lines that contain printk.
If no main file is found, the script displays “no main files..”; if no module file, it displays
“no module files...”.
 
code description
set up: make both files excutable
chmod a + x printDoc.sh
chmod a + x progStats.sh
The code for the first script uses echo, for in with find command, and sed command.
for in with find command can find all the c and h files by using *.c and *.h
echo can print a line of equal signs by echo "================"
sed can extract all the comments that start with "//+" end with "//-" by setting the starting
pattern "//+" and ending pattern "//-".
The second sed will substitute all the "//+", "//-" and "//" with "". In this way, all the 
leading comment delimiters can be removed.

The code for the second script uses echo, for in with find command, grep command, and if with then command.
The first "if" checks if the number of argument is one by using "$#" != 1; the name of the script is $0.
The second "if" checks if the first argument is a directory by using [-d $1] and runs the script by setting
the variable "hasMainFile" = 1; echo "main file"; for in with find "*.c" to get all c files and it also sets
the variable "hasMainFile" = 0 to indicate that main file exist. Therefore, if "hasMainFile" is still 1, then
echo "No main File"
The command grep -n can check whether "int main" and file exist
The command grep -c can count the number of lines of "fprintf" and "printf". Since prinf lines includes the sum
of fprintf and printf, so the printf is the result of grep -c printf subtracts grep -c fprintf.
Then do the same thing for module files but look for line numbers
The command grep -q can find the line number of printk.
